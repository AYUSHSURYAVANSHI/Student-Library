Tech Stack :

1. For making a library app we need to use an app which uses React JS for its Front-End.
2. For the Backend part i.e. for storing the data we can use Mongo DB and for developing api we can use node.js,express.js.
3. We will be requiring a strong source for the Tech information to be conveyed through the app.

What Can We Add ?

1. We can add the course books of classess 9th-12th and Engineering stuff.
2. We can add the links to the NCERT books of the classes 9th-12th and can include the most famous books of the particular subjects of specific branch of Engineering.
3. We can add some mock tests or previous year question papers to practice for 10th and 12th class.
4. we can give service of 1-1 Guidance to needy students.
5. We can add a to-do-list interface where the student can keep track of what to complete by when.

Things Needed:

1. Some good quality material.
2. The teaching videos can be of anyone like some personal instructors or the youtube videos.
3. App Developers who all will be maintaining the app.


Things what exactly a student wants?

1. A student is always in search for a strong guidance which should be given through our app. For that the app must be containing the videos of some great and experienced personalities.
2. After the guidance a student needs a course from scratch to advanced which can teach him the topics from beginning.
3. For that course we must provide the student with some good video material to sharpen the project.
4. After that for the reference the app must provide links and download option to the most famous and renowned books of the particular subject.
5. As the app will also be servicing the engineering students, the app must also contain some material for the placement like it should include some Placement Series where the guidance and resources will be provided for the interview rounds and for the coding exams.
